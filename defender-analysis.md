# Defender Analysis

## Who is trying to defend the system?
- The primary party trying to defend the system are the owners and operators of the vending machine.
- Other significant parties involved in its defense would be campus administration itself and payment processors.

## What resources do they have access to?

### Machine Operator
- The machine's operator likely has access to physical security measures on the machine such as a strong casing for the machine itself and locks to keep it's contents secure
- They also likely have access to some sort of transaction log, tracking purchases made with both physical and digital payment methods, ideally helping them notice and prevent unusual activity.
- The operator likely has some sort of alarm or alert system in place so that if the machine were compromised physically or digitally they would be alerted.

### University Administration
- The university has security cameras all across campus, ideally catching or deterring anyone acting against a vending machine.
- The university also has access to appropriate physical response in the form of security and the campus police to both deter and apprehend who may be at fault.
- In the case of a digital attack the university has access to their information security team to ideally deter and catch those at fault.

### Payment Processors 
- Payment processors serve as a form of protection for the users of the vending machine incase their payment information is stolen, an example of this would be a payment skimmer.
- Payment processors can block fradulent payments ideally protecting both the user and owner of the vending machine.
- In the case that fradulent activity is not identified until after the transaction, payment processors can work to reimburse customers.
