# Threat Assessment on Vending Machines – COSC 366
This repository contains Group 9’s project for _COSC 366 - Introduction to Cybersecurity_. The project focuses on assessing security risks in vending machines, identifying potential threats, constructing attack trees, and proposing mitigation strategies.
As part of our research, we analyzed the architecture, data workflow, and user interactions of modern vending machines on the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) campus to understand potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.

### **Collaboration Guidelines**

- **Add your work directly to the `main` branch** if it's ready for the main project.
  - **Create a new file** with the appropriate naming convention: `part-description.extension`.
  
- **Use a separate branch and Pull Requests (PRs)** if you'd like the team to review your work before merging into `main`:
  1. Create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `part/<short-description>`).
  2. Push your changes to that branch.
  3. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch and request feedback from the team.

- **Ensure all file names follow the naming convention**:
  `feature-description.extension` (e.g., `user-flow-diagram.png`, `payment-system.md`).

- **Commit messages** should be clear and concise, describing what was changed or added in a few words.
