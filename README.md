# Threat-Assessment-CS366
This repository contains Group 9â€™s project for COSC 366 - Introduction to Cybersecurity. It focuses on threat assessment, analyzing potential security risks, and implementing mitigation strategies.


## **Collaboration Guidelines**

- **Add your work directly to the `main` branch** if it's ready for the main project.
  - **Create a new file** with the appropriate naming convention: `part-description.extension`.
  
- **Use a separate branch and Pull Requests (PRs)** if you'd like the team to review your work before merging into `main`:
  1. Create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `part/<short-description>`).
  2. Push your changes to that branch.
  3. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch and request feedback from the team.

- **Ensure all file names follow the naming convention**:
  `feature-description.extension` (e.g., `user-flow-diagram.png`, `payment-system.md`).

- **Commit messages** should be clear and concise, describing what was changed or added in a few words.
