# Adversary Analysis

This report analyzes adversities targeting vending machine systems. This analysis will examine their objectives, methodologies, and capabilities. 

### Adversary Profiles
__1. Internal Threat: Disgruntled Employee__

The insider threat represents a big risk to vending machine security since they have privileged access and contain knowledge about the system

OBJECTIVES

Attackers such as these seek to cause financial harm to the company, steal products/cash, or cause operational disruption.

METHODS
* Distributing sensitive information to external parties for a share of the profits 
* Compromise inventory tracking mechanisms in order to reach their objective

CAPABILITIES

Their position provides advantages such as:
* Valid system credentials and access rights
* knowledge of system vulnerabilities (this can be either physical or something within the software)
* Knowledge of operational schedules


__2. External Threat: Criminal Group__

OBJECTIVE

These groups focus on a large scale theft of cash or products. They can also install malware for wider network access (although this is rare).


METHODS

* Physical break ins such as breaking the glass with a tool
* Network attacks if machine is connected 
* social engineering of maintenance staff who can have access to sensitive information 

CAPABILITIES: 
* Technical skills that could allow either physical break ins or network access
* Experience with similar attacks that they could have done before

__3. Local Thief:__

OBJECTIVES:

Their goals focus on immediate gains through the following:
* Direct product theft (such as vending machines that contain expensive technology)
* Cash extraction (this can occur from any type of vending machine)
* Quick opportunistic attacks

METHODS:

Their approach typically involves:

* Counterfeit currency in order to avoid paying for the product
* Tool based attacks to destroy the glass of the vending machine

CAPABILITIES:

* Individual or small group operations
* rapid attack execution
